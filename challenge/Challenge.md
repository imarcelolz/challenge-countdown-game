# Countdown Frontend Challenge

Your task is to build a clone of the famous [“​Countdown​” TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)) game show with one key difference: In Countdown, there may be several correct words, but in this game, there is only one.

## Rules of the game:
* The correct word is randomly selected (Create an array with some words to choose from)
* 9 letters are displayed (both correct and incorrect)
* The player should drag and drop the letters into the empty fields
* The player has 1 minute to complete the word
* If the player wins, they see a success message
* If they fail, they see a fail message and an option to try again
* The user can fail by either running out of time or by choosing the wrong letters 3 times.
* The only way to win is to spell the correct word

## Your solution:
* The minimum requirements are to match the design specifications and to build a functioning game
* You are welcome to be as creative as you wish
* You can use third-party libraries, please document why you have used them
* Feel free to add suggestions for future improvements as well as assumptions you may have made

## Expectations:
